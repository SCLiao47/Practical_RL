If you are knowingly infinite, please adjust `t_max` to something more reasonable.\n","* __No discounted rewards__ - we assume $\\gamma=1$. If that isn't the case, you only need to change two lines in `rollout` and use `my_R = r + gamma*child_R` for `propagate`\n","* __pickleable env__ - won't work if e.g. your env is connected to a web-browser surfing the internet. For custom envs, you may need to modify get_snapshot/load_snapshot from `WithSnapshots`.\n","\n","#### On `get_best_leaf` and `expand` functions\n","\n","This MCTS implementation only selects leaf nodes for expansion.\n","This doesn't break things down because `expand` adds all possible actions. Hence, all non-leaf nodes are by design fully expanded and shouldn't be selected.\n","\n","If you want to only add a few random action on each expand, you will also have to modify `get_best_leaf` to consider returning non-leafs.\n","\n","#### Rollout policy\n","\n","We use a simple uniform policy for rollouts. This introduces a negative bias to good situations that can be messed up completely with random bad action. As a simple example, if you tend to rollout with uniform policy, you better don't use sharp knives and walk near cliffs.\n","\n","You can improve that by integrating a reinforcement _learning_ algorithm with a computationally light agent. You can even train this agent on optimal policy found by the tree search.\n","\n","#### Contributions\n","* Reusing some code from 5vision [solution for deephack.RL](https://github.com/5vision/uct_atari), code by Mikhail Pavlov\n","* Using some code from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/blole/dfebbec182e6b72ec16b66cc7e331110)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"JodgBxU1yjNe","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
